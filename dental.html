      <h2>Check Up</h2>
      <p>
        We are keen advocates of regular check ups as a preventative measure to identify potential issues before they become bigger problems.  They are important because your dentist can identify problems early, before you even notice them. This allows us to treat issues early, when they are easier and less expensive to deal with.  
        We may take x rays to screen for deeper issues like decay hiding under your fillings or under the gum line, fractured teeth, and problems with wisdom teeth.

        <h2>Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
          Modern scale and polish techniques are pain free, and an effective preventative treatment in dental care.  Your hygienist will gently clean your teeth, removing staining and any plaque build up, checking for signs of gum infection or bleeding.  Cleaning in the clinic is more effective than using your toothbrush at home and also allows us to spot potential problems early.

      <h2>Fillings</h2>
      <p>
        If you are experiencing tooth sensitivity or pain due to decay, fillings are an effective way to eliminate pain, and restore the function and appearance of teeth.  They can also help to restore the appearance of damaged or broken teeth. Our modern and gentle dental care techniques allow us to restore your teeth with minimal discomfort.
      </p>

        <h2>Orthodontics</h2>
        <p>
          Damon braces are a modern train track system that allows the teeth to move passively into place creating a full smile . There is less pain than with the old train track system as there is no tightening and there is no filing between the teeth unlike Invisalign.
          Choosing the right brace for you is one of the most important decisions when deciding to straighten your teeth. At your consultation visit we shall explain the difference between all of the available treatments and guide you to making the best decision for your teeth
